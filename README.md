# Space-Time Simulator

This project provides a Python implementation for simulating space-time dynamics using second-order mathematical models. It incorporates vector calculus operators (curl, divergence, gradient) and supports customizable boundary conditions for numerical simulations.

## Purpose

The simulator is inspired by the theoretical work in "Space Time Potential Theory: A Fundamental Second-Order Approach" and aims to model physical systems governed by second-order wave equations. The code offers tools for:

- Curl, divergence, and gradient computations.
- Handling boundary conditions.
- Supporting simulations of electromagnetic, gravitational, and fluid dynamics fields.

## Features

- **Curl Operations:** Converts electric fields (E) to magnetic fields (H) and vice versa.
- **Gradient and Divergence Calculations:** Computes spatial derivatives critical for wave equations.
- **Boundary Condition Handling:** Allows for user-defined boundary conditions such as Dirichlet and Neumann.
- **Modular Design:** The code is structured for flexibility and extensibility.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- NumPy library (`pip install numpy`)

## How to Use
